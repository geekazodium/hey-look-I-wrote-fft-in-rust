# learning rust by writing an implementation of FFT and iFFT

I leared a bit about the basics of rust, recently I was watching a video
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7apO7q16V0) about the FFT algorithm, and
I wanted to try my hand at coding it at some point, I had no idea how
the algorithm works, so I learned how it works by trying to code it myself
it's a dumb little project, if anyone would like to be so kind, please roast
the heck out of my spaghetti code, I'm new to learning rust so I definitely
am not following all of the best practices.
